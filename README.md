# üè© Hotel Management System

For our compliance with SIA102 (Systems Integration and Architecture 102) in Quezon City University this project does have

- Booking Reservation
- Forum Assistance
- Content Management

Note: In terms of e-payment we wanted to achieve the Stripe's integration but we ran out of time for some reason talk is cheap keep sending bugs!!

Progress: Do not expect it's solely used for academic purposes.
